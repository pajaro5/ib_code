Term: Superclass,The parent class in an inheritance relationship from which other classes derive functionality.
Term: Subclass,"A child class that extends a superclass, inheriting its members and potentially adding new ones."
How does inheritance affect access to 'private' members of a parent class?,Private members are inherited but cannot be accessed directly by the child class.
Define 'Method Overriding'.,A feature where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
What is 'Static Polymorphism' (Method Overloading)?,Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
Explain the concept of 'Abstraction' in OOP.,The process of reducing complexity by hiding irrelevant details and focusing on essential characteristics.

Describe the 'Observer' design pattern.,A pattern where an object (subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them of state changes.
What is 'Modularity' in the context of OOP?,"Breaking a program into smaller, self-contained parts (modules) that can be developed and tested independently."
How does OOP facilitate 'Code Reusability'?,By allowing developers to use existing classes as templates for new ones through inheritance and composition.
What is a 'Method Signature'?,"The combination of a method's name and its parameter list (number, type, and order of parameters)."
State one advantage of using OOP for complex problem solving.,It allows for a more intuitive modeling of real-world systems through hierarchical relationships and objects.
State one disadvantage of using OOP.,It can lead to increased memory usage and overhead compared to procedural programming.
"In Python, what is the role of the `self` keyword?",It represents the instance of the class and allows access to the object's attributes and methods.
"In Java, what is the role of the `this` keyword?",It is a reference to the current object whose method or constructor is being called.
What type of relationship is described by 'Inheritance'?,"An 'is-a' relationship (e.g., a Salesman is an Employee)."
What type of relationship is described by 'Composition' or 'Aggregation'?,"A 'has-a' relationship (e.g., a Car has an Engine)."
Why is 'Encapsulation' important for maintaining the 'Integrity' of an object?,It prevents external interference that could lead to an inconsistent or invalid internal state.
How can OOP be applied to database development?,By mapping classes to database tables and objects to individual table records.
When should instance variables be used instead of class variables?,When each object needs to store its own unique data that should not be shared with other instances.
Explain the significance of the `protected` access modifier.,It allows members to be accessed within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
Which OOP mechanism implements 'Dynamic Polymorphism'?,Method overriding.
What happens to subcomponents in 'Composition' when the parent object is destroyed?,They are destroyed along with the parent object.
Why are 'Design Patterns' useful for recurring programming challenges?,They provide proven architectures that increase code maintainability and scalability.
How can 'Abstraction' help in developing modular code fragments?,By defining clear interfaces that allow different modules to interact without knowing each other's internal logic.
"In the 'Los Pollos Hermanos' scenario, why is 'Employee' defined as a class?",To serve as a general template that defines common traits like ID and name for all types of staff.
"In the 'Los Pollos Hermanos' scenario, if Walter White is an instance of Employee, what is he technically called?",An Object.
The ability to use a child object wherever a parent object is expected is a core part of _____.,Polymorphism
Which design pattern is most suitable for a 'Logging' service that should only exist once in memory?,Singleton
What is the purpose of the `super()` function in a subclass constructor?,To call the constructor of the parent class and initialize inherited attributes.
Which UML relationship implies that a 'Department' can exist even if the 'University' it belongs to is closed?,Aggregation
Why is it important to use 'Type Hinting' in Python OOP for IB students?,It helps students connect Python code to IB Pseudocódigo by explicitly stating expected data types.
What is the result of using a private attribute without a getter method?,The attribute becomes inaccessible to any code outside of the class it is defined in.
How does polymorphism contribute to 'Code Flexibility'?,It allows a single method call to behave differently depending on the object type it is invoked on.
State one reason why 'Decomposition' is used during OOP design.,To break a complex system into manageable classes and objects that are easier to implement.
"In the context of OOP, define 'State'.",The current values of an object's attributes at a specific point in time.
"In the context of OOP, define 'Behavior'.","The actions that an object can perform, represented by its methods."
Which OOP principle is best applied to secure network communications by hiding protocol details?,Encapsulation (or Abstraction).
Explain the difference between 'static' and 'dynamic' binding.,"Static binding occurs at compile time (overloading), while dynamic binding occurs at runtime (overriding)."
How does the 'Observer' pattern facilitate scalability in machine learning models?,By allowing multiple visualization or logging tools to react to model updates without modifying the model itself.
What is the primary risk of not using encapsulation in a large-scale project?,"Increased coupling, where changes in one part of the code cause unexpected errors in unrelated parts."
"If a method is marked as 'abstract', what must a concrete subclass do?",It must provide an implementation (override) for that abstract method.
Why is 'Aggregation' considered a 'weak' association?,Because the objects have independent lifecycles and the part can exist without the whole.
"In UML, where is the return type of a method written?","After the method name and parameters, separated by a colon (e.g., `getName(): String`)."
What is 'Code Management' in the context of OOP modularity?,The ability to update or debug a specific class without affecting the rest of the system.
Why are constructors not typically used to implement business logic?,Their primary responsibility is solely the initialization of the object's initial state.
How does inheritance simplify the creation of 'specialized' classes?,By allowing the specialized class to focus only on its unique features while inheriting general features from a parent.
"In Python OOP, what does a single leading underscore (e.g., `_salary`) suggest to other programmers?","That the attribute is intended for internal (protected) use, though it is not technically private."

What is the significance of the 'Public' access modifier in a collaborative software project?,It defines the 'API' or set of methods that other team members are allowed to use to interact with your class.
Can a class be both 'Abstract' and 'Static'?,"No, because abstract classes are designed to be inherited, while static members belong to the class itself and cannot be overridden."
Explain the 'Is-A' test for inheritance.,"If you can say '[Subclass] is a [Superclass]' (e.g., 'A Cat is an Animal'), inheritance is likely appropriate."
What is 'Dynamic Polymorphic Behaviour'?,"The runtime selection of a method implementation based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type."
